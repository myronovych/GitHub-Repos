# GitHub-Repos
Simple implementation of an App which searches for repositories using GitHub API.
I also wanted to make it with Rx, but as its totally new for me I could only manage to start reading RayWanderlich book about RxSwift and try something more simple with it.


- [X] Gives 30 first result of search;
- [X] Pagination was done;
- [X] Screen is not blocked while fetching result;
- [X] Repos are sorted by number of stars;
- [X] When you tap on repo, its being opened on a browser and cell is being marked as visited;
- [X] Visited cells are being saved with a help of NSUserDefaults.
